"""
latent_rl: Reinforcement learning (RL) for LatentMorph.

This package focuses on training lightweight control components (e.g., trigger policy + condenser) while keeping
the large Janus model and most control modules frozen. It implements rollouts, rewards (CLIP/HPS), and a GRPO-style
policy-gradient trainer.
